## **Task 1: Credit Scoring Model**
Objective: Predict an individual's creditworthiness based on their financial history.
Approach: Implemented classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Key Highlights:
Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering on financial datasets (income, debt, payment history, etc.).
Compared models using evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
Identified the most influential financial factors for predicting creditworthiness.

## **Task 3: Disease Prediction System**
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptoms.
Approach: Built a multi-class classification system using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest.
Key Highlights:
Collected and preprocessed symptomâ€“disease mapping datasets.
Engineered features to handle categorical symptom data effectively.
Evaluated models with Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Delivered a system that can predict possible diseases from given symptoms with good accuracy.

## **Task 4: Handwritten Character Recognition**
Objective: Recognize handwritten alphabets using image-based deep learning models.
Approach: Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras for training and prediction.
Key Highlights:
Preprocessed handwritten character images (grayscale conversion, normalization, augmentation).
Designed and trained a CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.

Achieved high accuracy in recognizing English alphabets.

Demonstrated the application of deep learning for real-world OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks.
